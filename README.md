## Description
A comparative analysis of dynamic management (DM) strategies across marine and terrestrial systems, focusing on the scales underlying DM approaches in these domains.

## Analyses and Data
All cases from the systematic literature review were coded into `data/cases.csv` and include information on domain, year, spatial scale, temporal scale, and regulatory mechanism.

All figures were made with `scripts/generate-figures.Rmd` and can be seen in knitted document `scripts/generate-figures.md` or as png files in `scripts/generate-figures-files/figure-markdown_github/`
